# Evolution log

Changes made on the `experimental` branch, newest last. Each entry: what changed, why, how it was verified. The nightly run reads this to avoid repeating work.

## 2026-10-09: QuVI added to the Lab (owner preview)

**What:** a browser port of QuVI, Murtaza Vefadar's LabVIEW quantum-circuit toolkit (MIT licence). It has:
- a state-vector engine for up to 6 qubits, with QuVI's gate set: I, X, Y, Z, H, S, T, Phase, RX/RY/RZ, controls, anti-controls, swap and Z measurement
- a wire-and-block circuit editor with a step-through timeline
- inspectors for probabilities, state vector with phase, Bloch spheres, reduced and full density matrices, and per-qubit entropy and purity
- his examples: Teleportation, Grover, QFT-4Q and Superdense coding, plus Bell and GHZ

**Why:** to prepare the QuVI experiment for the Lab. The permission email promised that nothing goes live without the author's approval, so it's visible only to the signed-in owner until `QUVI_PUBLIC=1` is set (`/api/lab/features`). Credit and the full MIT licence text are on the page.

**Verified:**
- `node frontend/quvi/engine.test.mjs`: Bell, GHZ, teleportation fidelity for every outcome, superdense coding, Grover certainty, exact QFT amplitudes, anti-control, swap and norm all pass.
- pytest at baseline (12 pre-existing failures), plus a new feature-flag test.
- `build_hal.py` builds.
- Browser checks for anonymous (hidden, plus a "Coming to the Lab" notice at /quvi/), owner (card and simulator) and public (card, no badge). Every tab at 1440 and 390 px, with no page errors and no horizontal scroll.

**Files:** `frontend/quvi/*`, `frontend/lab.js`, `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/theme.css`, `backend/lab.py`, `backend/api.py`, `backend/tests/test_lab.py`, `CLAUDE.md`.

## 2026-10-09: New PiTechLab mark and a friendlier welcome

**What:**
- The circle-and-diameter logo is replaced by a friendly mark: a hand-drawn π on a cobalt tile, its right leg curling up, with a small spark. It's used for the sidebar brand, favicon, permission page and welcome screen.
- The site is now named PiTechLab, with ScholarPi as its assessment tool.
- The welcome screen has a warm greeting and the mark drawing itself, then four doors with icons: assess and improve a paper, research the corpus, explore the map of science, and experiment and test in the Lab. Below them, a line saying the site improves nightly, linking to this log for the running branch, and a "Skip to the site" link.

**Why:** the owner didn't like the old logo and wanted the welcome to feel friendlier and to name what the site is for: research, lab, testing, assessment, improvement and innovation.

**Verified:**
- pytest at baseline, `build_hal.py` and the QuVI engine tests.
- Browser at 1440 and 390 px on every tab, with no page errors and no horizontal scroll.
- Welcome: focus lands on "Let's begin", a door opens its tab, the brand reopens the screen, and Skip and Esc close it.
- With reduced motion, the π strokes show fully without animating.

**Files:** `frontend/welcome.js`, `frontend/theme.css`, `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/icon.svg`, `frontend/confirm/index.html`.

## 2026-10-09: Total cap on stored manuscripts

**What:** `backend/paper_store.py` now has a total budget for retained manuscripts, `PAPER_STORE_MAX_TOTAL_BYTES` (default 2 GB, `0` turns it off). When a new upload would go over it, the store evicts orphaned files first (those with no assessment left), then the oldest stored manuscripts. A single file larger than the whole cap is not stored. The owner Storage panel shows how much of the cap is used and a warning from 80%. That warning says eviction removes the file link from published papers.

**Why:** the store had no total limit and filled the production disk. A full volume stops the database as well, not only uploads.

**Verified:**
- New `tests/test_paper_store.py` (6 tests) covers under the cap, oldest first, orphans first, an oversized file, a failing provider and a disabled cap.
- pytest is at baseline (12 pre-existing failures, 370 passed).
- `build_hal.py` builds.
- `/api/admin/storage` returns `manuscript_cap`.
- Headless Chromium, every tab at 1440 and 390 px, signed out and as a mocked owner: no page errors and no horizontal scroll. The Storage panel was screenshotted with the warning showing.

**Files:** `backend/paper_store.py`, `backend/api.py`, `backend/tests/test_paper_store.py`, `frontend/app.js`, `EVOLUTION.md`.

## 2026-10-09: The circling mark returns

**What:** the owner preferred the circle. The logo is back to the circle and its diameter, now without a centre dot, and the diameter turns slowly with the cobalt point riding its end: on the welcome screen inside the ruled ring, and in the sidebar mark. The favicon stays still. The friendlier welcome layout (greeting, four doors, nightly-improvement line) stays.

**Verified:**
- Browser at 1440 and 390 px, with no page errors and no horizontal scroll.
- The diameter's rotation is measured mid-turn.
- No centre dot is present.
- With reduced motion, the mark is still and fully drawn.

**Files:** `frontend/welcome.js`, `frontend/theme.css`, `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/icon.svg`, `frontend/confirm/index.html`.
